# Law of 100

## What is law of 100

Most people quit way too early. They try something a few times, don’t see results, and give up. That’s a mistake. If you commit to doing something 100 times—whether it’s launching products, making sales calls, or posting content—you’ll get better, guaranteed.

The magic happens after the reps. The first 10 feel awkward. The next 20 show progress. By 50, you’re onto something. By 100, you’re in a different league.

Most people never get there. Don’t be most people. Hit 100. Then decide if it’s worth quitting.
